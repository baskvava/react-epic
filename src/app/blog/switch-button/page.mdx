## Let's start it 🚀

This is a simple and common switch button. Only three elements needed. `label`, `input`, `div`. Let's dirty our hands to build it. 🐱‍💻

<Switch />

## Step 1

Use `input` with `type="checkbox"` because its behavior is the same as checkbox.
Only two states used for Swtich: `checked`, `not checked`

### Our goal is fully hide `input`. Use another element `div` to create the gray oval shape to cover the `input`. But We still need the type of `checkbox` of `input`, which ability make use know its state (checked or not checked)

1. Use the `Label` to wrapper `input` and `div`

2. For `Label`, give it cursor pointer style

3. For `input`, set checkbox type and sr-only class (`sr-only` means screen reader only)

4. For `div`, set css style as gray oval shap. It's the real shap for switch, including its toggle effects (will explain in the follwing section). At this stage, we only set up its basic css style.

##### 💻 Example

<Switch11 />

##### 💻 Example Code

<CodeBlock language="html" code={rawSwitch11} />

> Use the class `sr-only` in `input` to hide checkbox. Otherwise, it will show a litte bit on the left top corcner

Here is the clear example. Let us easily differentiate them.

##### 💻 Example - Without sr-only

<Switch12 />

## Step 2

### Use the pseudo css to add the toggle circle at `div`

1. For `Label`, add relative for pseudo css to align

2. For `div`, add aboslute and give it white circle shap

##### 💻 Example

<Switch21 />

##### 💻 Example Code

<CodeBlock language="html" code={rawSwitch21} />

###### Now, we've finished 80% on it 🙌

## Step 3

In this section, we only focus on `input` and `div`

### Let's make it toggle with some animation.

1. For `input`, add `peer` class. It's Tailwind CSS specific class.

2. For `pseudo`, add the animation `transition-all`

3. For `div`, add `translate-x-full` for `peer-checked` to move circle and change background color

> Add `peer` at `input`. Add `peer-checked` to `div`. So, `div` know that css class should change when `input` state change (checked or not checked).

###### Weeee did it! 🎉 🎉 🎉
